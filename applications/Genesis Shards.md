### Overview

Please provide the following:
- A brief description of the project.
A self sufficient team, we have build a suite of DeFi products across multiple blockchains. This includes: 

Genpad  *V2* adapts a unique DeFi + NFT model. Unlike any other launchpad, we issue unique NFTs to every user.

The split of DeFi and NFT communities results in liquidity and attention span being split alienating the two communities from each other as there are no overlapping/common benefits.

Our product solves this by enabling cross-community **engagement by bringing relevance across both DeFi and NFT spaces.*

1) GENPAD v2
Genpad = Launchpad + NFTs + Tribe  Genpad is an IDO launchpad which creates and airdrops a kickass, customized NFT collection to users, to help create a tribe-like following for your project. Tested and proven product line with over 30+ successful launches which has raised over 1.55 million USD for our partners. Built a strong and organic community of over 100k users.
WHY?
- A powerful launchpad for projects #BUIDLing on your chain
- Make powerful new partnerships by leveraging our technology, marketing and extensive Web3 network 
- A unique, customized set of NFTs is created just for your project 
- providing instant gratification for the investors  
- The NFTs also help create your project's very own tribe 
- a set of loyal, long-term supporters

2) NFT MARKETPLACE
A multi-chain NFT trading platform
A state-of-the art NFT marketplace, with multiple chains already integrated and with many more in the pipeline.
WHY?
- lncreased on-chain liquidity generated by NFT trades for partners 
- Multi-chain support to capture a wider customer base  
The split of DeFi and NFT communities results in liquidity and attention span being split and thereby alienating both communities from each other. 
We intend on solving this by introducing a product that caters to both communities.  

3) STAKING PLATFORM 
- A multiple staking product line platform that can be tailored to users’ requirements. 
- NFT Rewards Staking: First-of-its-kind staking product with NFT rewards 
- Cohort Staking: Staking with multi-token rewards 
- Single Asset Staking: Flexi-staking solution with token rewards  

4) ALLIANCE GUILD 
- To maximize the potential of our partners and to build a stable community that contributes to its members' growth 
- The Alliance guild currently has a comprehensive network of blockchain projects, access partners (top VCs and hedge funds), a global KOL/influencer network and top-tier mentors in the crypto space. 
- We share: Deal Flows, Partnership Opportunities, Private sale pitches, AMA & Podcast opportunities & Upcoming events & insider leaks
  
5) LIQUIDITY MINING 
- Partner projects can do LM on the Platform

## Development Roadmap 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:

- Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost. 
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of details must be high enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
- Please commit to providing dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
